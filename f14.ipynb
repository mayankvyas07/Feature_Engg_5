    "The Spearman's rank correlation (rho) is 1, which indicates a perfect monotonic relationship between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level.

    "Preference for Soft Drink: [30, 45, 20, 15, 10]\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for age and preference for the soft drink, we follow the steps as shown in Q1. However, it's essential to understand that the Pearson correlation coefficient is not appropriate for ordinal categorical data like age groups.\n",

    "After calculating the coefficient, we can interpret its value to determine the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week. A positive correlation would indicate that as the number of sales calls increases, the number of sales made also tends to increase, and a negative correlation would indicate the opposite"
